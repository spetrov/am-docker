             purposes, pretty much everything _except_ the config GUI at this
             time.

             The config GUI resides under $requestContext/config/ with
             two notable exceptions:

             There are two paths that existed in the project prior

             $requestContextPath/config/federation/*  and
             $requestContextPath/config/auth/default/*

             To ensure there are no interference with them, they have also been
